# Line
What do you think you know about Lines?
What assumptions do you hold about the true nature of a line? Do they even exist? What are their purpose?

Once we shed our assumptions and deconstruct our understanding of "A Line", we can start to build it back up from the basics. And the basics, in the case of "Line", are defined in the context of geometry. Euclid provides the definitions of such basic shit, we forget that there was ever even a need to define them. For example, he defines [Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)) as a set of points obeying a linear relationship. A series of points that are connected.

Lines are useful components of every day life. They separate things from other things and they connect things to other things. One line alone can represent a quantity, or symbolize a negation of everything the line touches.

Lines comprise the visual elements of letters, which form words, which speak silently to us through our eyes once we've been taught to interpret their associated sounds. They convey meaning once we understand how to read them. They suggest meaning even if we have no clue how to read them. 

In writing, they serve to guide the hand across the page in "a straight line". 

Lines, combined, create patterns. Pattern-recognizing machines like our brains love to try and figure out the meaning of the patterns of lines that we see. 

The goal of a line is to facilitate clarity. It is firmly functional. 

The line that stands out within letters to distract from the intended meaning of the word as a whole, is a line that sucks. Think of how upset people get when you use the 'Comic Sans' font. It's too distracting. It's "out of line." Lines are traditionally very stiff and inflexible in these contexts. 

That's why, in the context of art, lines are free. They play. They let their hair down. They are not obligated to be straight, or follow a set of rules. They make their own rules within the space they occupy, they form patterns that suggest meaning that isn't necessarily obvious to the viewer. The artist can lay down lines that play tricks and misdirect the viewer's attention to create an effect.

In art, Line has the same capacity to clarify, segment, separate, point to, align, and explain things as they do elsewhere. But they are not enslaved to those ends. They are not defective or failures when the viewer is not instantly elucidated by lines that follow the conventional patterns of letters and words and grids.

They can convey a signal full of noise. They can obfuscate. They can represent chaos as much as they can provide order. All according to the artist's intentions, and that is the fun of exploring the effects of Line. 

In reality, lines communicate so much information about the reality around us that they fade into the background of our perceptions easily. What is a door if not a series of lines? A bookshelf? A ceiling?

We see the line that separates one thing from another, and almost instantly our brain assigns meaning to what we see. "That's the wall; that's the ceiling." But stare at it for a moment and let your eyes relax... and you can see there is a line there, separating the two concepts visually. Seeing the world through slightly different eyes like this on a regular basis is how a person becomes an artist. Artists use that vision to translate what we see in the 3D world onto a two dimensional plane. 

Often it starts with putting down lines, and becomes more complex from there.

After all, that is how early humans interpreted their world through cave art. It's also how we first learn to express our knowledge of the human form. A stick figure is a way of communicating the concept of "a person". It's so common and fundamental that it barely registers as "art" to some people. But in truth, drawing a stick figure is the foundation of a person's capacity to translate what they know about the world into a visual language.

Put another way, translating the human figure into a pattern of individual lines is an entry point into a new language. A language and a context of visual artistic expression, where the rules don't exist until they are set down on the page. The method the artist uses to communicate meaning is their own visual vocabulary. Their own grammatical structure. Their own interpretation of reality. 

If there is something specific that the artist wants to communicate, that can be achieved. Goals can be set, broken down into steps, and worked towards. That process is called "practice", and is similar to the scientific method. Setting out to achieve something in particular, an effect or a "look", can end with a surprise. As with science, so it is in art. Go in with a hypothesis, experiment, and observe the results. 

This is the most basic explanation of a line. 

So if that is what a line is, what is its purpose? Specifically, what is its purpose in art?

## Line Practice
There are some common techniques that one can practice to get experience laying down lines. Line practice comes down to how well your hand can control the outcome. The goal with this practice is to get to know the different kinds of lines as they come from your hand, your soul, your mind. Some you will enjoy drawing, others will not feel as good. The point is to acquaint yourself with different kinds, and give them a chance. Practice. Get a feel for them. Let them be wobbly and let yourself be bad at it and let it be boring. But try to find the fun in each one. Let your imagination and mind play while you focus on filling up a page with lines. 

Whatever you do, don't connect them end-to-end. That's something else entirely!

If you intend to draw a straight line, 
- Draw straight lines
- Draw curved lines
- Draw squiggly lines
- Draw bouncy lines
- Draw zig-zagging lines
- Draw meandering lines
- Draw a line that feels sad
- Draw a happy line
- Draw lots of lines fast. Flick your wrist
- Draw a line that starts fast and ends slow
- Fill a section of a page with short, fast lines 
- Fill an entire page with the same kind of line. Put on some music or a show while you do this
- Try to make every line on the page parallel '
- Try to recreate the same length, thickness, and pressure line
- Draw slow, deliberate lines
- Draw curved lines that are close together but do not touch
- Make lines that start thick and taper towards the end
- Make lines that have no logic, that cross and bend
- Fill a page with lines that bend in sharp angles
- Fill a page with 1 line that snakes around without crossing itself
- Fill a section of a page with lines that go one way, then another
- Cross lines on top of each other
- Experiment with the weight of pressure you put on the line
- Draw very soft, light, thick lines
- Draw very sharp, deep, thin lines
- Draw lines in a free-flowing ink pen
- Draw lines in pencil
- Draw lines with a pen that has ink that does not flow well 
- Draw lines very close together
- Draw lines very far apart
- Draw different kinds of lines in a reoccurring pattern
- Once you find an angle for your wrist that is easier to create quick lines, turn the page itself on different angles. 


This is a meditative exercise that does is not one-and-done. It's a doodling practice that can be done anywhere, on anything. Coffee cups, post-it notes, reciepts... all you need is a pen and something to draw on, and the desire to feel your hand move across the page. That is the sensation to focus on, not the end result. 

However, it _does_ feel nice to look at a fully filled page. So I encourage you to try and fill it up completely and see how it feels once you're done.
