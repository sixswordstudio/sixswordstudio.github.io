### _Spoilers ahead_

The Road. An unorthodox novel published in 2006 by prolific author Cormac McCarthy. Bleak world; austere fiction. While the setting and the experiences of the protagonists are overtly dark in theme and description, it is the subtle style of McCarthy's writing which abets an ambivalent atmosphere. Sentence fragments.  No quotation marks, no apostrophes, no distinctive indication of who is speaking; no comfort, no hope.

The novel centres around a man and his boy as they keep themselves alive, for vague reasons, in an equally ambiguous post-apocalyptic environment. The motif of whether or not to kill themselves reoccurs throughout the novel, and the reader is brought along the road towards the question: “Why live?” 

Why does the man beg his wife to continue living, when he knows as well as she does the reality of the world they live in? “They are going to rape us and kill us and eat us and you wont face it,” (56) she reminds him, and yet he continues to beg her to stay. Why? Why would anyone continue in the face of such hopeless meaningless existence? Are the good people, those who “carry the fire,” simply fodder for those who thrive remorselessly in the new paradigm of evil?

It would be comfortable to assume that such existential questions occur apart from every day life, in some nebulous future hellscape like that of The Road. I believe, though, that there is more to the dying planet setting than its function as a blunt symbol of warning against the dangers of global warming. Rather, that it is metaphoric; an envisioning of the present broken world in which existence drudges on, generation after generation. 

With this in mind, questions rankle like cankers at the core of our drive to survive. Can a parent, with good conscience, bring a child into a world they know is saturated with wrongness and evil? The boy's mother confronts this question:

>“My heart was ripped out of me the night he was born … Breathe it into being and coax it along with words of love. Offer it each phantom crumb and shield it from harm with your body. As for me my only hope is for eternal nothingness and I hope it with all my heart,” (pg 57).

She then kills herself, while the man continues to live. The reader is left with more questions: was it evil of the woman to leave her family, or was it evil of the man to want to create a family in the first place? Are there any options left in that context which are really truly good? Are there any black and white answers to questions such as these, or is everything as grey as McCarthy's ashen landscape?

There are no easy answers to be found in the reading of The Road; rather, it raises weighty questions about the nature of humanity, evil, and the world we live in. It leaves an ambivalent aftertaste that remains like residue on the roof of the mouth of the readers mind.
