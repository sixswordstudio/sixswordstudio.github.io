# What is API and its value to developer users
Reliable and comprehensive API documentation serves as a vital reference library for developers working with software, without a user interface. Expert users with advanced technical skills often find it inefficient to rely solely on a page's layout and input fields for their common workflows, and prefer to get things done via API.

Many products support these advanced use cases by providing API endpoints for users with advanced permissions to perform actions without a GUI (Graphical User Interface). This allows users to optimize their workflows to perform actions in bulk, or automatically based on programmatic logic. Here are the most common actions users take using API:

- **POST**: Typically used to create new resources or submit data to the server. When you use a POST request, you are usually sending data to the server to create a new resource or trigger a specific action.

- **GET**: Used to retrieve information from the server. It doesn't modify any data and is often used to fetch data.

- **PUT**: Typically used to update an existing resource with new data. It can be used to modify a resource completely or partially, depending on the implementation.

- **PATCH**: Also used to update an existing resource, but it's usually for making partial updates rather than replacing the entire resource like PUT.

- **DELETE**: Used to delete a resource from the server.

Because these actions can be executed programmatically, fully supported API access enhances the value of our product. This is a major selling point for enterprise-level SaaS subscriptions, and can entice decision-makers to upgrade a subscription to a premium tier of service. Zendesk, for example, has API endpoint access as a feature highlight of their enterprise plan.

### API Documentation

API documentation is not just a reference guide; it's a critical tool that bridges the gap between a product's capabilities and the developers who use it. Effective API documentation can make the difference between a seamless integration and a frustrating user experience. Here are some challenges and best practices to consider when documenting APIs:

#### Challenges in API Documentation
1. **Complexity and Scope**: APIs can be complex, with numerous endpoints, parameters, and potential responses. Documenting every aspect accurately and thoroughly is essential but challenging, especially as the API evolves.
   
2. **Audience Diversity**: API users range from novice developers to seasoned experts. Creating documentation that is both beginner-friendly and detailed enough for advanced users requires careful consideration of content structure and language.

3. **Keeping Documentation Updated**: APIs often undergo frequent changes, including new endpoints, deprecated features, and updates to existing functionality. Ensuring that the documentation remains up-to-date with these changes is a constant challenge.

4. **Demonstrating Practical Use Cases**: While technical details are important, users also need to understand how to implement the API in real-world scenarios. Providing clear, relevant examples and use cases is essential for effective documentation.

5. **Error Handling and Troubleshooting**: API users will inevitably encounter errors. Documentation should provide guidance on common pitfalls, error messages, and troubleshooting steps to help users resolve issues independently.

#### Best Practices for API Documentation
1. **Interactive Examples and Sandboxes**: Allow users to experiment with API requests in a safe environment. This can be done through interactive examples or sandboxes where users can test API calls without affecting live data. These tools help users gain confidence and understanding without fear of making mistakes.

2. **Clear and Consistent Structure**: Organize the documentation in a way that makes it easy to navigate. Use consistent headings, subheadings, and terminology throughout. This structure helps users find the information they need quickly, whether they are browsing or searching.

3. **Comprehensive and Up-to-Date Content**: Ensure that all endpoints, parameters, and response formats are documented. Regularly review and update the documentation to reflect changes in the API. Use versioning to indicate updates and provide access to older documentation for users on legacy versions.

4. **Examples and Code Snippets**: Include practical examples for each endpoint, showing how to structure requests and handle responses. Providing code snippets in popular programming languages can make it easier for developers to integrate the API into their projects.

5. **User Feedback and Iteration**: Encourage users to provide feedback on the documentation. This can be done through surveys, direct contact options, or community forums. Use this feedback to continually improve the documentation, addressing common pain points and clarifying confusing sections.

6. **Security and Best Practices**: Educate users on best practices for securely using the API, such as managing authentication tokens, handling sensitive data, and avoiding common security pitfalls. Providing this information helps protect both the users and the platform.

7. **Accessibility and Responsiveness**: Ensure the documentation is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. It should also be responsive, meaning it works well on various devices and screen sizes, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

By addressing these challenges and following best practices, you can create API documentation that empowers users, reduces support costs, and enhances the overall value of your product. Effective documentation not only serves as a reference but also as a tool for learning and innovation, helping users to fully leverage the capabilities of your API.

### Inpirations and great examples
- [Shopify Developer Docs](https://shopify.dev/docs)
- [Vitruvi Software Developer Docs](https://developers.vitruvi.cc/reference/list_labor_items)
- [Atlassian Developer Docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/)

**Why they are effective:**
- The knowledge is written for the audience's use-case
- The home page uses space efficiently and is responsive to different sizing
- There are 3 different ways to access the knowledge immediately available:
    - Clicking a card for common practices
    - Selecting an option from the nav menu
    - Using the search bar
    - Scrolling down to explore more entry points into the knowledge
- The content is separated into two common menu options; one being purely technical reference library organized alphabetically, and the other containing conceptual articles organized categorically.

## An example of documentation strategy
- Assess the current health of the knowledge base and identify key areas of opportunity for rapid success (low effort + high value impact)
- Assess the statistics and data for user engagement on the knowledge base, topics, and individual documentation pages
- Evaluate the internal production cycle and set a documentation roadmap that matches the scale and velocity of the business.
- Establish or attend regular touchpoints with product managers and developers to understand the features under development and the implications of those developments on the software's API.
- Document, verify, and publish any changes or additions to the content.
- Establish or support a verification cadence to ensure no documents go stale due to inattention over time
- Provide regular communications of changes through established channels (active or passive updates)
- Set and monitor key performance indicators for the knowledge base and indivuals, tied to measurable outcomes.
