Shepherd's Pie is the perfect comfort food when the weather gets cooler and the leaves turn colour. This recipe provides the basic building blocks for a quality dish to suit any dinner table.

# Structure of the dish
A basic shepherd's pie has three base components: 

- Meat mixture
- Potato topper
- Spice and flavour

Each of these can be adapted for different diets.
## Meat mixture
A basic sheperd's pie contains ground beef, but common alternatives include ground pork, lentils, or a rice-and-quinoa base. 1 lb of lean ground beef will make enough for two servings. 
## Potato topper
Yukon gold mashed potatoes are the classic topper for a basic shepherd's pie, but can be substituted to suit different tastes or themes. Sweet potato, rice, or mashed cauliflour can all serve as substitutions that are prepared in the same way. 

## Spice and flavour
Spice is the most subjective aspect of a good meal. Each aspect of the meal has its own flavour profile. The following ingredients combine well in their respective parts of the meal for a classic Shepherd's pie flavour. 

### Meat mix
Basics include tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion, bell pepper, peas, carrots, and corn.
### Potato topper
Basics include butter, sour cream, salt, and cheese.

> “I turned to the plates and scooped out the shepherd's pie. As I broke through the thin crust on the mashed potatoes, the most amazing aroma enveloped me. A similar version was one of Mom's favorites; it was one dish she never burned, never oversalted, and always made into a celebration. Jane and I used to fight over seconds. 
> But tonight it was mine---and it was better than Mom's. I always added a bunch of oregano and cinnamon to the tomato base to give it extra richness. And for this pie I'd used more vegetables, mincing them super fine, and used a bit of grass-fed ground beef rather than relying exclusively on the lamb---the first naturally thickened the base, and the second softened the taste.”
