# Why make a website
Building your own website to host a portfolio is a prime way to have complete control of your content. The look and feel of the site is fully in your hands, for better or for worse. The technical challenge is surmountable with the right resources, and this guide aims to bring those resources together for the self-guided learner.

# Who can build it?
This guide assumes that you have a baseline understanding of the web, but have not taken your own steps yet to build and configure a website. This is a basic walkthrough that takes you from having none of the tools and no experience at the start, to the end goal: an online landing page that other people can visit. Any extra features and dynamic functions are beyond the scope of this guide, but we will link out to next steps you can pursue once you've got a website up and running.  

# What do you need to do it? 
Software tools that you will need in order to complete this process are:
- Github
- VS Code
- Ruby
