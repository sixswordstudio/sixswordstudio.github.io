# My Career Part 2: Building the Balance
_[**Part 1:** How Funerals Shaped my Career](https://sixswordstudio.github.io/how-funerals-shaped-my-career)_

In this article, I posit that the pursuit of a balanced life, where career and personal aspirations are harmonized, is essential for achieving long-term stability, fulfillment, and self-actualization.

### The power of perspective

There is nothing as powerful as perspective. Nearly ten years after my time in funeral service, and seven years after starting a technical writing career, I have data to look back on. And I have a vision for the decade ahead.

While data is often seen as cold and detached, it can also tell a compelling story. Without a complete set of data, how can we understand the full story? And without the full story, how can we make wise decisions? _How I feel_ is a valid data point, and there's nothing more personal than that. 

> Whenever Apaches describe the land — or, as happens more frequently, **whenever they tell stories about incidents that have occurred at specific points upon it — they take steps to constitute it in relation to themselves. Which is simply to observe that in acts of speech, mundane and otherwise, Apaches fashion images and understandings of the land that are accepted as credible accounts of what it actually is, why it is significant,** and how it impinges on the daily lives of men and women.   
> In short, portions of a world view are constructed and made available, and a Western Apache version of the landscape is deepened, amplified, and tacitly affirmed. **With words, a massive physical presence is fashioned into a meaningful human universe.**

### Seeking sustainability

I believe it is wise for me to seek a profession where I feel competent and that is sustainable in the long-term. That is a Holy Grail worth chasing. I love writing, editing, collaborating, and learning new things. 

For over ten years, I've been doing 'more for less,' providing great value, and digging deep to find a path beyond mere survival. I want more than just survival; I want to thrive. Thriving means having the resources to care for my disabled mother, buy a home, and start my own family—all of which require a salary that matches my experience and skills.

### The importance of stability
Early in my career, I faced burnout from overwork and under-compensation. This experience taught me that true sustainability isn't just about gaining more experience by doing more; it's about creating a balanced loop of fulfilling job responsibilities that support long-term success and well-being for myself, clients, the company, and all stakeholders. 

The right combination of duties and rewards can provide the stability I need to support my family. My efforts over the years—my striving, reaching, and learning—haven’t been solely for personal satisfaction. It’s about achieving a vision many of us share: to "have it all," both a fulfilling career and a stable family life.

Women in business approach this vision of balance in unique ways. Some have more choices or a shorter path to success, while others face steeper challenges. Regardless, I believe in honoring and supporting every woman’s journey. Just as Athena helped me with a small but meaningful gesture, like donating shoes, we can all find ways to lift each other up. "Having it all," whatever that looks like for each person, should be attainable. I hold onto what Barack Obama called the 'audacity of hope,' believing that community, opportunity, and freedom is possible for everyone.

### Navigating career and womanhood
While seeking stability in my career, I also grapple with the challenges of navigating womanhood in the professional world. I recognize that discussing womanhood in the context of career growth can sometimes feel taboo. It might seem counterproductive to mention that I may want to become a mother. However, it's now 2024, and many companies now understand that a person can be dedicated to both their career and their family. I seek a role where this dual dedication is not just accepted but actively supported, and where I can work alongside like-minded individuals.

Over the past decade, I’ve thrived on change, adapting like Shackleton navigating the treacherous Drake Passage. My true north has always been to support my family, which is why I returned to my prohibitively expensive hometown near Toronto, rather than staying out west amidst the beautiful mountains and backcountry. I’m here because I’m needed, and despite the challenges, this is where I want to be. With the right support, I believe I can make this dream a reality.

### Building the balance
Reflecting on my journey, I see that achieving balance is not just a goal but an ongoing process of adjustment and growth. For me, true balance means finding fulfillment in my career while also nurturing passions and projects beyond work and family. Whether it's through personal writing or other creative pursuits, these activities are essential to my self-actualization—they are what make life rich and meaningful beyond the professional and home spheres. I intend to make the most of every day, knowing that the opportunities I embrace in the next few years will shape my future and determine whether a balanced life is truly possible..
