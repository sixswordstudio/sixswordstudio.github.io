One unexpected outcome of the rise in AI is the research and validation being done to improve model training. What this author has noticed as a knowledge management professional is that _model training and validation techniques_ can be logical and applicable as guiding principles for human practicing knowledge management too. 

Managing information effectively has always been crucial, and therehave a ton of evidence and concrete best practices to reference when developing a business strategy for managing knowledge at scale. 

One of the Generative AI model training techniques is called Generative Adverserial Network (GAN). 

GAN pits a generative model against a discriminative model to rapidly iterate and improve the generated output. 

While GAN is a purely technical solution for a purely technical problem, the underlying principles can be applied as a business strategy for knowledge management. This article for knowledge professionals offers a light introduction to how GANs work and suggests a way to use that structure to better manage business knowledge across teams at scale.

_**Note:** This guide assumes a basic understanding of Machine Learning, AI, and SaaS business concepts. The author recommends this Datacamp certification course as a good source for prerequisite knowledge in AI Fundamentals._

## Topics in this guide
- What does GAN do in Generative AI
- Why is it effective?
- What are the underlying principles of GAN?
- How to apply those principles in a business context

### What does GAN do in Generative AI?
- **Generative Model:** This part of a GAN creates new data that mimics real data.
- **Discriminative Model:** This part judges the quality of the generated data against actual data.

These two models work together, improving each other through their interactions. This process ensures continually improving outputs.

### Why is GAN effective?
The effectiveness of GANs lies in their adversarial nature. By having two models challenge each other, both are driven to improve. The generative model learns to produce more accurate imitations of real data, while the discriminative model becomes better at identifying discrepancies.

# Underlying principles of GAN
- **Adversarial Feedback:** The core of a GANâ€™s effectiveness is the ongoing feedback between the generative and discriminative models. This results in better outputs.
- **Continuous Improvement:** As each model challenges the other, both evolve to become more efficient in their tasks.

### Apply GAN-style principles in a business context
Adopting GAN principles in business knowledge management can create a dynamic feedback system between subject matter experts and support teams, continuously improving the quality and accuracy of company knowledge.

## Teams that generate and teams that review
**Product development teams** act like the _generative model_, creating and updating company knowledge. They are the SMEs.

**Quality Assurance teams** function like the _discriminative model_, reviewing the content for accuracy and compliance with standards. This can be an actual QA team, or support teams if they are well-versed in the customer's perspective. They can help pass human-iterative feedback from customers through the system to flag inaccuracies.

## Continuous feedback loops and iteration
Content goes through continuous development cycles of review and revision, enhancing or refreshing the quality of the documentation with each iteration. Participants get credit for being a part of the content review process. 

Different product domain teams gain recognition and compete to have the highest scores for their product knowledge across key metrics like freshness, accuracy, and accessibility. 

## Business benefits:
- Improved accuracy and reliability of information.
- Increased innovation due to the challenge of meeting high standards.
- Scores can be measured and tracked as a health metric or KPI

## How to implement?
These are ways we could apply these concepts in a practical way to deepen or establish a healthy culture of knowledge sharing.

**1. Define the Roles and Responsibilities:** Clearly outline what each team is responsible for in the knowledge creation and review process. Bake knowledge management into the job descriptions and expectations, then reward people for doing their job or going above and beyond.

**2. Establish Evaluation Criteria:** Set clear standards for the Quality Assurance teams to assess the content. Make it easy and remove any unnecessary friction from the process. Bake these processes into existing workflows as much as possible, and reward those who go above and beyond for users.

**3. Develop Feedback Mechanisms:** Ensure there are efficient channels for the teams to communicate their feedback and suggestions. Automate as much as possible and stay lean. 

**4. Train Teams:** Educate both teams not only on their tasks but also on the strategic importance of their roles in managing knowledge. Celebrate successes, motivate them to compete in good faith by offering meaningful rewards for "most improved", "most consistent", and other key categories.

Businesses can profit from the new developments in AI by applying the principles of adverserial training technique at a higher conceptual level. By adapting the technique as a knowledge management strategy, the business as a whole will be able to scale their knowledge over a short period of time as the company grows. Turn bottlenecks into opportunities and un-bog developers. Why let machines have all the benefits of advancements in machine learning, when the same logic can be transferred and applied outside of a computer programming context?
