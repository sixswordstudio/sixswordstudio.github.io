# How did I enter the role of a funeral service attendant?
This is a long story, but I have decided to post it in its entirety so that I may look back on these events myself. If you find it interesting, or wish to know more, I encourage you to email me at 4my.p4rk@gmail.com

### Before funerals, fashion
**TL;DR**
- _The author worked at a consignment clothing store, Funk your Fashion, in Nanaimo, BC, under an eccentric entrepreneur owner._
- _A key experience involved troubleshooting a POS terminal issue during a busy cruise ship day, showcasing problem-solving skills._
- _The job at Funk your Fashion was meaningful, and the author valued the teamwork and support it provided._
- _The author also self-published a book of poems during this period, overcoming challenges using limited resources._

In 2016, I was trying to transition out of the role of cashier. In Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, where I had been studying Liberal Arts and processing impactful events that had changed the course of my life, I worked at Funk your Fashion (Now known as Funk Revival). This was a consignment clothing store, owned and operated by the eccentric, bombastic, and fantastic Greg Badger, who rollerskated through the streets of Nanaimo dressed in a sandwich board to drum up business.

One day, we were expecting a surge in customers due to a cruise ship that had docked in the Nanaimo harbour the previous evening. A cruise ship day was always at least 200% busier than average; not only were there lots of cruise-goers shopping local, but the ship staff would also list items for consignment at Funk your Fashion then pick up or spend their earnings in the shop the next time they arrived in town. We loved their business, and local buyers loved the thrill of finding international gems for a bargain. And it was sustainable, keeping these fabrics out of the landfill for another lifecycle in someone's wardrobe. 

During that cruise ship day rush, it was hot. We were already sweating before the only point of sale terminal broke, while the tiny space filled up with people waiting in line holding their armloads of like-new lululemons and well-worn Cowichan sweaters.

After unsuccessful preliminary troubleshooting steps, our manager Kat put up a sign and informed the customers, **Cash Only**. Disappointed clients left their shopping at the desk; I continued troubleshooting.

I checked the docs on my phone and called the number on the back of the terminal. They confirmed no indication of issues from their end, which narrowed down the scope of the problem. If it was a purely local issue, what else could it be?

The POS terminal was plugged in to a lone powerbar stretched out at the end of an extension cord that had been taped to the floor for the past 10 years, so I found a new one in the back of the shop, and plugged it in. When the POS was plugged in, the terminal turned on and booted up as normal. Once we replaced the old powerbar that had reached the end of its natural lifespan on cruise ship day, everything worked as expected. 

I was proud to have fixed an issue that would have plagued my team all day, with minimal downtime to secure the card sales from cruise ship day. High fives were exchanged all around, and we pumped the jams after locking the doors to vacuume and tidy up at the end of the day.

While I was, on paper, just a cashier, the job and the team and the business meant a lot to me. My career ambition at that time was to make more than $1400 CAD a month, but not to lose that feeling of being a part of a team of people who really pull together on the stressful busy days. Or that feeling of helping the business, which was the vehicle for my friends' financial freedom in this world.

### The side project: a humble book
The decision to move to Vancouver was tough, but necessary. My options in Nanaimo were stagnant, even though I had achieved a personal milestone; during the dark and emotionally draining final days of 2014, I self-printed a book of poems. Just to put a stamp of polish on a bunch of draft material, not to sell but to have for posterity. Just like any other "first album", made at a time when I had very little to invest with. The inherent limitations of the project led to an artistic challenge; can I get this done even without any paid tools and resources?

The local library had a book printing machine, but there was no one available to help me learn how to use it because they were on break for Christmas holidays. I was alone out West, my family 6500 km away in Toronto, and I wanted this book printed before new year. 

So I asked for permission to read the book machine's documentation and reference guides. Then used the library's free time slot on the Mac desktop to learn how to use InDesign. I referred to Google, StackOverflow, and Adobe docs, and followed the reference guidelines to put the text and cover images in correct alignment. It was all set to go, and the clerk had earlier demonstrated how to print. So I copied the file from the mac to a usb drive, and uploaded the usb to the printer. Then followed the prompts on screen until it was time to press the button.

The book machine, which was a rube-goldberg-like sequence of smaller machines passing the product between the different stages of development, all within a clear plexiglass box. When I pushed print, it began to print the pages of the book as any other printer would. But then the stack of printed pages would be passed towards another printer, which was printing a high quality glossy photo onto softcover novel material. Stapled in place along the spine, then dropped into a folding scheme that pressed the two sides into book shape. The front was now the front and the back was the back, stack of paper with my words on it printed out and fitted with a cover I had designed, featuring a photo I took of a painting I had painted. The folder finished folding, and turned the book sideways, ready to pass it into the margin cutter to have the length and width of all the pages adjusted to production specifications. 

But before the margin cutter could grab my book, it slipped through the grippy bit and into the inner workings of the machine. We pulled it out, it was only a little squashed, with uncut margins. But it was mine, and complete. Except, the colour of the front and back were not adequately saturated, so I made adjustments and printed the second copy. 

It also got stuck in the machine, and had to be fished out by library staff with the key to open up the plexiglass box. Again, he reached in and rescued my book, and it was just a little smushed in the same spot as before, but the colours were brighter and the darks were darker, so it was perfect.


### Responsibilities of attending to viewings
**TL;DR**
- _The author transitioned to a role as a Viewing Attendant at a funeral home after moving to Vancouver and facing a difficult job market._
- _This role involved setting up and maintaining a respectful environment for viewings, assisting guests, and performing various support tasks._
- _The author reflects on how this job helped them process personal grief and provided a meaningful way to serve others._

After that, I felt ready to move forward, closing the chapter of Nanaimo, because although I loved it out West, I needed to find a way back to my family. But I stayed on for another year while I prepared and saved what I could for the move. The job search in 2015 was bleak. There were all the usual cashier positions, dog daycare attendants, and a front desk position at Urban Barn, but none of these opportunities manifested in a job offer. 

I found a job listing for an on-call Viewing Attendant and read the description. All the bullet points were well within my range of competencies; I felt confident that I could do this job. But I hesitated. Was I confident that I could do _this_ job? I passed on it when I got a second interview at Urban Barn, but they didn't call me back. 

Then my grandmother passed away, and I couldn't afford the flight to Toronto for her funeral. 

It got me thinking about that job posting for the Viewing Attendant in a different light. In a way, it felt appropriate for me to spend time serving funerary traditions, to try and make up for missing my grandmother's funeral.

So I applied, and figured that I could suss out my boundaries as I go, in terms of proximity with the deceased. To see how I feel and go slowly into any encounters with conscious awareness, respect, and positive intention. 

The manager of Ocean View Funeral Home, Athena Theodorakakis, interviewed me at a dark glossy wood table in a dimly lit room. She was a calm and present leader, assuring me there would be no pushing of boundaries around anything post-mortem. As an Attendant, I would only focus on facilitating operations during Viewings. Anything that would make anyone squeamish would be handled by the funeral directors. The director who arranged the services would leave a folio of documents with specific instructions and plans for the viewing, while an on-call director was always available to check in, or show up, if we needed help during an event.

Athena confirmed the job description. My role as a Viewing Attendant would be to tidy up the pews, make the candles presentable, make myself inconspicuous, and facilitate a calm atmosphere in the chapel for viewings, often held at night before a larger funeral and burial. One of our team would push an already prepared casket into the place of honour in the chapel, and then fill out required fields in the chain of custody documentation. Another attendant would arrange flowers according to strict specifications from the Director's folio. One of us would set up crosses or crucifixes or burning barrels, or we would work together to clear space for the practicioners of faith bringing their own setups. We would boil water in kettles and set out hot tea, coffee, and decaf urns. We set out catering platters and made all comforts fresh and available. We took turns scrubbing the bathrooms.

We ushered guests inside, answered their questions, and kept them from wandering down the wrong hallways. There were never as many guests at a viewing as there were at the formal funeral. The viewings were always intimate, stressful, and emotionally charged.

During the service, our role was to be present and attend to any needs that arose during the time that the family would be in the main chapel with their loved one. We would be responsible for operating the audio and video equipment to play slideshows, music, and DVD recordings on cue. When the doors were closed for privacy, we would quietly discuss and get to know each other, if the doors remained open we would typically sit at the back of the chapel or in the director's office, and listen respectfully. We were there to provide assistance.  

One time, a client family requested that I place a ring under the palm of their loved one's hand. I called the funeral director, who said if I felt comfortable to do so, it would be ok to do it. And so in service, I did it, and it was ok. It meant a lot to them, so it was worth it. 

I witnessed many celebrations of life; portraits and candid photographs, each sliding into the next, to portray a memorial for the chronological arc of a person's whole life. 

After the event, our responsibilities would be to tidy up the kitchen while the other washed dishes. We ran the vacuumes together to cover different areas at once. In the warm silent candle light of the funeral director's office inside the chapel, I filled out the chain of custody document and the day's report while my elder colleague sat with a cup of tea. We discussed noteworthy events, she gave me insight into this position as it fit in to her career. As a retiree, this was good work for her. Above minimum wage, low impact on the joints, and in a serene setting. Hard work, here, was sustainable. In every room, soft fabric panels and wallpaper held the heavy silence and a lingering scent of parafum, floral arrangements, and something else. It all was softened by ever-present, ever gentle piano music.

Once everything had been put in its proper place, one of us would wheel the casket in to the safe and cozy room that only staff can enter, in the centre of the funeral home's labyrinth of green carpet hallways, and cover it in a protective blanket. Then, tuck the chain of custody documents into a fold in the blanket, and turn off the lights.

I took the job, and had to admit to Athena that I couldn't afford the initial cost of shoes that would fit the uniform requirements, even for the company to reimburse me later. I had maxed out my credit moving apartments from Nanaimo to Vancouver, and Bell was about to put my phone in a time out until I caught up. She said no problem, and presented me with a pair of shoes before I left work that day. Athena said they had been donated through a program for professional women supporting women. The care and consideration she gave by connecting me with these resources made such an impression on me. She helped me acclimate to the role as I dove in, setting me up with a framework for success.

### Still not enough to pay the bills
**TL;DR**
- _The author took a second job at H&M for financial stability while continuing as a Viewing Attendant._
- _The fast-paced physically demanding retail environment led to a shoulder injury, prompting a focus on healing and contemplation of future career paths._
- _The author began exploring remote work opportunities and eventually applied to Shopify, driven by a desire to support businesses and entrepreneurs._
- _The author received the benefit of women supporting other women in business, when a Director gave positive feedback and career encouragement._ 

While I was testing the waters as a viewing attendant, I heard back about a job at the fast-fashion retail giant H&M. They offered stable hours that I could count on, while the funeral home was on-call with shifts scheduled only when a funeral director can get all the green lights to book time and resources for the viewing arrangements. The on-call Viewing Attendant was paid above minumum wage, but the hours were initially low and unpredictable. My expenditures were the internet, rent, groceries, and a spotify subscription. And, I wanted to save, too. Build up something to do something with. Often I would volunteer for shifts, and given that they were in need of flexible coverage, it was a good match. I lived nearby and walked to work, whenever they needed support coverage braced against the Vancouver rain and snow.

For the next month, I worked both jobs.

H&M, even though I knew what it was going to be when I went in to it, was a culture shock. The strict and rapid pace, the unrelenting customer service. The weight of the oversized hoodies. The volume of materials, lifted by the grace of my weak and malnourished scapula. Predictably, years of repetitive lifting and shoving motions made me susceptible to a shoulder injury, which I sustained over the course of that season. I was advised by my physiotherapist to let it heal or else risk losing mobility. So I retired from fashion retail.

However, the training and onboarding from H&M stuck with me. The public information they put out about their ethical manufacturing facilities and recycling programs filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge about what happens before a product gets to the shelf. This was the total opposite of everything I had experienced with Funk your Fashion's small consignment business model, and I was fascinated. 

Around this time I started looking into businesses whose employees were working remotely, as I had a great experience as an editorial intern in a hybrid model where I worked a day or two a week at home. There had always been stories about people working A friend reached out and reccommended Shopify. His wife had a good experience working there. I looked into the requirements to apply, but they were not hiring at that time. 

So I was a Viewing Attendant for several months while healing from a torn scapula, trying to figure out the funeral business I was in, do some research, and write more prose instead of poetry. I completed the training modules in the SCI Learning Management System, and watched all the OSHA videos. Everything had this early 2000s corporate VHS patina. The company was based in Texas, and as far as I could tell, the Vancouver location had not been updated in a while. Asking the Funeral Directors questions led to interesting discussions about the operations of arrangements and the process of becoming a Funeral Director. And also, their responsibilities. 

There were certain things involved that I knew I could never do. 

But there were other advancement paths from Viewing Attendant. One of the directors took me to the side one day to compliment the work I had been doing, and suggested that I apply to be a Funeral Attendant. There were open positions at the central funeral home in the SCI network in Vancouver: Forest Lawn Funeral Home & Memorial Park. 

### Responsibilities of attending to funerals
**TL;DR**
- _The author advanced to a more formal role as a Funeral Attendant, taking on duties like driving the hearse, leading processions, and managing funeral operations._
- _They learned about servant leadership through observing funeral directors and valued the formal service of attending to families' needs during funerals._
- _The author faced a career crossroads, recognizing that while they valued their work, they were uncomfortable with the direct handling of deceased individuals, which limited their advancement in the funeral industry._
- _Reflecting on the inspiring lives of entrepreneurs they encountered during funerals, the author was motivated to transition into supporting living businesses, leading them to explore opportunities at Shopify._

The role of Funeral Attendant was more formal and structured than the Viewing attendants, and we had more responsibilities. For example, I drove the hearse with the decedent in their casket to the funeral at a spiritual center, then led the procession to the grave site or crematorium. 

I was also responsible for casting the pall in certain funerals, and to be a neutral party responsible for the wellbeing of the family and the smooth operations of the funeral itself. 

There, I learned from Funeral Directors about true servant leadership by observing how they managed difficult questions, how they directed the crew of attendants, how they organized the day and kept things on track. All with an empathetic and understanding for what the families are going through. 

There were further opportunities for me along this path. I have always craved finanical stability and freedom, with benefits suitable to support myself and my family, and a path of advancement that will keep me continuously learning. However, the reality was that advancing any further in the business of funerals would put me in very direct contact with deceased people, and that side of the business was not for me. I was much more attracted to the highly formal and professional service of attending to the needs of families during the funerals. I could not see myself embalming, which was a key part of the funeral director career path, so I tried to advance in the direction of crematory operator instead. Alas, at this point, I had finally reached the limits of what I felt comfortable confronting on a day-to-day basis, and needed to transfer all the skills amassed from funeral service into an entirely new trajectory. 

While reflecting on my next step, I remembered being moved so deeply by the slideshows of people's lives that I had witnessed at all those funerals. It was my view that the most inspiring and full lives seemed to be the people who had been entrepreneurs. In our funeral demographic of Burnaby B.C, there were many people passing away who had immigrated from the Guangzhou region of China in the 20th century. So many slideshows showing so many people who came to this country hoping to make their own future, who had taken risks, away from their families of origin. And many decades later, I witnessed their final moments before the casket closes, the last eyes to see them. And they were surrounded by all their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, community, colleagues, and so on. 

During their funerals, we would drive their casket past their home to honour that home, to say a final farewell to the place that had cradled their families in life. Often, we would also drive past the place of business where entrepreneurs had worked hard their whole lives to build something tangible for themselves and their families. It was also a place of honour in their life.

This inspired me to do what I could to take the service leadership mentality that was so fulfilling in the context of funerals, and transfer that passion upstream of death and funerals. What if I could help people with their growing businesses while they are still alive? Entrepreneurship had the potential to transform lives, give people such freedom. I remembered Greg at Funk your Fashion, and how important his business was to his sense of identity, freedom, and self expression.

I decided to learn all I could about business, and apply to work at Shopify. Thanks to the stellar documentation on their help center and my own dedication to learning how e-commerce shops worked, I got the role.

### Conclusion
- _At Shopify, the author began as a remote customer support agent, developing strong documentation skills and a reputation for thorough internal notes and positive feedback._
- _The author's experience and admiration for Shopify's documentation led them to apply for a technical writing position, despite having no prior experience in the role._
- _The transition to technical writing felt like a return to the author's roots in writing, where they excelled with the support of their team and leadership._
- _The author is passionate about nonfiction writing, particularly in the tech field, and seeks to continue growing in this career path while filling in gaps in their knowledge._

While at Shopify, I started out as a remote customer support agent. During that time, I developed a reputation for thorough internal notes taken in a structured format that ensured asynchronous collaboration over time and between teams. I also had an unbroken streak of positive feedback from business owners I supported. So when I found that the Technical Writing team was hiring, I felt compelled to apply. I was in awe of the impressive and accessible docs that had enabled me to teach myself the technical skills required to transfer into the industry, and I wanted to learn how they did it. 

Applying for my first role as a technical writer was a risk, but it was worth taking; I had never done that job before, but it was also a return to my roots. Writing is something that I had been trained to do in Liberal Studies, and in my internship in editorial writing at the magazine company BCS Group. I was familiar and comfortable being edited by others, and being detached from the work itself -- I write best when the content is not "about me", but about the truth. In tech writing, that means facts about the technology. 

Writing in this nonfictional way became my favourite form of writing, and the mentorship that I received in that role solidified that this was the career for me. I took a chance, and thanks to the teams I was a part of and the leadership of my managers, I excelled in the role. It is my goal to find another opportunity where I can fill in the gaps in my knowledge, to become an even better resource for the company I work for.

This is where I will wrap up the already quite long story about how I became a technical writer. I started in the middle of the journey, and there is more to the tale, but I will save those stories for another day. If you have read this, thank you for your interest in my path and hope to hear from you in the future.
