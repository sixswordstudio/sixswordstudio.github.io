# Managing Third-Party Documentation: A Technical Writer's Approach
In the context of software development, third-party tools and integrations are essential to the ecosystem. As a technical writer, effectively managing and documenting these integrations is critical. This article outlines my current understanding of how to approach documenting third-party tools, drawing from my experiences working with various platforms. Once I learn more about the best ways to approach 3rd party documentation, I will update this article with that that knowledge.

## Understanding the Context
When dealing with third-party documentation, the first thing to understand is the broader context of the product development roadmap. It’s important to have a bird's-eye view of each year’s quarter, focusing on the company’s goals and targets. This understanding allows me to make informed decisions about whether to build solutions in-house or subscribe to third-party vendors. The stakes, costs, and potential benefits must be assessed to determine the most strategic approach.

## Data-Driven Decision Making
Before integrating a third-party tool, I analyze past retrospectives and decision points to understand what has worked or failed previously. This analysis helps guide the implementation and documentation process. For example, when integrating tools like Apryse and OpenReach within our product, it was essential to consider historical data and use feedback to avoid repeating past mistakes or adding technical debt in the future. 

The key is to ensure that our users have everything necessary to do what they need to do, without adding technical debt. 

## Creating User-Focused Documentation
User experience is at the core of my documentation process. When documenting third-party tools, I focus on creating content that is concise, relevant, and easily accessible. For instance, while working on Vitruvi, I encountered a scenario where the QA/Support team wanted extensive documentation of the third-party UI. I opted instead to produce short, targeted videos of our key workflows, which referenced the Apryse software but did not focus on it. This would provide users with the necessary guidance to complete their task without overwhelming them with information, however I was not there long enough after taking this approach to ascertain the effectiveness of this compromise. I'm hoping to deepen my knowledge of the puzzle in future positions, and learn from mentors about what the best approach for these situations may be.

## Ensuring Usability and SEO
Effective documentation must also be discoverable. At Vitruvi, I ensured that all documentation was optimized for search engines and user queries. After identifying that old release notes articles were cluttering search results, I took steps to restructure the documentation to improve click-through rates and overall usability. This led to a significant overall improvement in user engagement, specifically the click-through rate.

## Continuous Improvement with Kaizen
It has been reflected to me through my manager's feedback that my approach has a lot in common with the principles of Kaizen. Since learning about this business philosophy, I have leaned in to it. 

In the context of third party tool documentation, Kaizen emphasizes continuous, incremental improvements. This involves regularly collecting feedback from users and stakeholders to ensure that the documentation remains relevant and useful. By identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement, I aim to take efficient action that will lead to impactful changes, that contribute to the overall success of the documentation and the user experience.

## Conclusion
Managing third-party documentation requires a strategic approach that balances user needs, company goals, and the capabilities of third-party tools. By focusing on context, collaboration, and continuous improvement, I ensure that our documentation is not only accurate and up-to-date but also enhances the overall user experience. This process allowed us to make the most of the third-party integrations while balancing the need for high standards of documentation quality and delivering documentation on time. 

In my next opportunity, I sincerely wish to deepen my understanding of this aspect of the craft by learning from discussions with technical writing mentors and those who have more experience than I do.
